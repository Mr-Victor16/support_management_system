# Support Management System [Backend]
Support Management System is designed to efficiently manage technical support tickets, meeting essential requirements for submission, tracking, and resolution. Users can submit tickets and monitor their status, while support operators can respond to tickets and adjust their status, priority, and category. Administrators manage user accounts and configure ticket settings, including status, priority and category lists.

This system was originally created as an individual project for a university course in Programming Platforms. The backend was developed using Spring Boot, Spring Security and an H2 database, with the frontend built using HTML and Thymeleaf.

The project was later refactored to a REST API backend to provide a more modern and streamlined solution. During this process, redundant features were removed, and technologies such as Docker, JWT and JUnit were integrated to enhance the systemâ€™s functionality and scalability.

## Technologies used
